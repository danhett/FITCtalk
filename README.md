# FITC Amsterdam 2017

This repo contains the slides, assets and speaker notes for my FITC Amsterdam 2017 presentation, "Don't Get Comfortable". http://fitc.ca/presentation/dont-get-comfortable/

I decided to distribute my content like this for a few reasons.
- Firstly, last year I ditched OSX and switched to Linux full time, meaning that my Keynote content is no longer easily usable.
- Secondly, I constantly say I'm going to send out resources and things, and forget every time. This way, links and additional thoughts are stored with the talk, so anyone can go back through it and get more info.
- Third, I like the idea of using open source technologies to power the talk. It's slightly more clunky than an easy Keynote pres, but the whole thing is stored in Github and works anywhere on any platform, and this is a huge huge plus for me.

At the time of writing this I've not actually written or delivered the presentation, but if you're reading this after seeing me do it, I hope it went well. ;)

As ever, always keen to hear thoughts and feedback through the usual channels.
