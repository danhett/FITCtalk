					<h1>Hello.</h1>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="assets/bg/bg2.jpg">
					<h1>Dan Hett</h1>
					<h4>TECHNOLOGIST/ARTIST</h4>
					<aside class='notes'>I'm somewhere in between a creative programmer and digital artist. Put another way - I write code for a living, but I absolutely regard myself as a creative who happens to use software, rather than a software guy who stumbled into art and design.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="assets/bg/bg3.jpg">
					<h1>ABOUT THIS TALK</h1>
					<aside class='notes'>I generally hate talks where someone stands on stage for 45 minutes and jerks off about their portfolio, and so I'm not going to do that. This talk doesn't even have any finished work in it. And although I'm gonna talk about programming a bit, if you're not a programmer I hope that everything I touch on will still apply to you. I hate technical talks too.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="assets/bg/bg4.jpg">
					<h1>DON'T GET COMFORTABLE.</h1>
					<aside class='notes'>What I want to talk about is my approach to creating cool stuff with computers, and along the way hopefully demystify some of the dusty old garbage that comes with programming. In particular, I really want to get into being comfortable, and why it's my firm belief that....</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="assets/bg/bg5.jpg">
					<h1>COMFORT IS YOUR ENEMY!</h1>
					<aside class='notes'>Whether your tool is Javascript, Photoshop, a paintbrush or the written word - as ANY kind of creative, being nice and comfortable is your absolute fucking nemesis. The overwhelming desire to not get too complacent, and to constantly interogate, destroy and rebuild my tools and my craft, have become a sort of central defining characteristic of my practice.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>MY ROUTE IN</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>My entry point to this stuff I think shaped a lot of why I feel this way. I actually didn't study computer science, at all, and in fact my degree is in Design and Visual Arts - I fell into programming very late on, when I needed to do more complicated things with Flash that bits and pieces of script weren't enough. I would never have chosen a Computer Science route, and I still wouldn't.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src='assets/violinist.jpg'</img>
					<aside class='notes'>Not that there’s anything wrong with studying computer science of course. I think of normal programmers being sort of the classically trained musicians...</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src='assets/guitarist.jpg'</img>
					<aside class='notes'>...to my three chord punk. Same core tools, wildly different approaches. And both perfectly valid of course, except the music analogy falls down a little bit because classically trained violinists don't go to punk shows and tell the band they're not playing their instruments properly, which is ABSOLUTELY what happens with certain programmers.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src='assets/baby.jpg'</img>
					<aside class='notes'>Luckily, I actually exclusively feed on the tears of crybaby neckbeards who tell me I'm doing all this incorrectly, or slightly inefficiently. They taste so good. What I did get from this was a valuable lesson though - it might suck for a bit, but actually you don’t NEED to be a classically trained programmer to get by. Obviously you need to learn, and there are good and bad ways to most things, but you don’t need to get dogmatic about most of this stuff. </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Slide about agency thing</p>
					<aside class='notes'>My first gig in the industry was a local agency, and let's be real here: I effectively bullshitted my way into a deveopment job. The big lesson here is that within reason, you should always say YES when an opportunity for money and/or excitement pops up. (of course this doesn't apply if you're on a plane and someone shouts "oh my god is there a doctor on the plane"), but for something as easy as writing a bit of code, yeah definitely! Fuck being classically trained! Google and a 'can do' attitude will get you 80% of the way, and the rest is dogged persistence and a willingness to fail (ideally when not on company time - I've done both)</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Slide about CBeebies</p>
					<aside class='notes'>From there I went to work for BBC Children's in the UK. This was a huge scale job, creating apps for millions and millions of users. Very high intensity and high pressure. </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Slide about BAFTA</p>
					<aside class='notes'>I even won a BAFTA, and picked up a few nominations. I only ever saw the BAFTA once, but it exists...</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Slide about BBC RD</p>
					<aside class='notes'>Finally I ended up getting a rare shot at a position for the BBC's prestigious Research and Development group, which I dived on. Now this is where things got interesting, because suddenly my colleagues were a mix of discliplines, skills and attitudes - far fewer classically trained programmers and a few more renegades! </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Slide about festivals and TV studios</p>
					<aside class='notes'>Suddenly I wasn't writing code at my desk, I was writing code in a TV studio, or at a festival! I was building things that weren't being stuck on the app store, or even facing users, but were instead just there to understand and test a problem out quickly and boldly. And this is the kind of thing I mean when I talk about not being comfortable. None of this was well-trodden tech, and none of the problems we were working on there were even remotely solved - and that's quite scary, but super fucking exciting. Part of striding forward is using the tools and languages you know well, in entirely unexpected ways.</aside>

				<section>
					<p>Slide about PERFECT GIG</p>
					<aside class='notes'>In many ways then, working for R&D was pretty much my perfect job, and so after a year I did what any sane, reasonable person would do... I quit.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Slide about WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS...</p>
					<aside class='notes'>And the reason I wanted to tell you about this is actually not *just* so people will know I'm now a hireable creative dev (although that's a handy side effect of standing on these stages)...</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Slide about FREELANCE</p>
					<aside class='notes'>...one of the main reasons for me making this move is, really, that I don't want to be at the end of the chain. Particularly as a developer there's this thing that happens where you get handed a fully-formed idea and are told 'here, build this'. And that, my friends, is comfortable. And if that's what you want to do, then that's totally cool, but for me this doesn't feel right. And to be fair, this was significantly less acute in BBC R&D, where we had a lot of agency to explore problems together and then solve them technically, we were still operating within research areas that someone else had defined - questions somebody else had asked. And so, I quit, and now I get to ask my own questions.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>SIDE PROJECTS BECOME PROJECTS</p>
					<aside class='notes'>And of course, like I'm sure many of you in this room, I almost always have a bunch of side projects on the go. My wife calls mine a 'crippling addiction' to side projects, which I think is a bit unfair, but - what's happened now is that some of my 'side projects' have turned into just straight-up work projects now, which is a really good thing. And I couldn't have done that without taking the leap out of full time employment and into the void!</aside>

					<p>EVOLVING PROJECTS</p>
					<aside class='notes'>One thing I did also want to get across is, one of the thing I most enjoy is taking technologies and using them for unintended purposes, twisting them into new forms. I am absolutely not the best programmer in the world, but I have developed a good eye for what stuff I can smush together. </aside>

					<p>Murder your tools!</p>
					<aside class='notes'>Taking tools and languages designed for one thing, and mis-shaping them into stupid new forms, is my jam. And I highly recommend this as a way of generating new ideas, approaches - ask yourself: how I can take this thing and contort the shit out of it until it does something else?</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Why short projects?</p>
					<aside class='notes'>Short projects (both side projects and for money) really suit me well - I have the attention span of a three year old, and I get bored really easily. My hard drive is littered with half finished stuff that hasn't seen the light of day because I got distracted by something else. And again, really that should make me a fucking awful programmer, right? Software projects are time-consuming and lengthy, right? WRONG! There are two specific reasons why short projects are amazing:</aside>

					<p>I'D LIKE TO END ON A QUOTE: NOT BY A DESIGNER OR PROGRAMMER, BUT BY THAT GREAT VOICE OF OUR TIME - DOUG STANHOPE</p>

					<aside class='notes'>In 1960, the New York Giants hired a kicker from Hungary. This is back when, if you watch old black and white NFL footage, they used to kick field goals really stupid and stiff, like a kid with rickets. And that was the norm, until they finally hired this soccer player from Hungary, and he came over and sees all these people - it had to be a lot of pressure, you sail all the way on a boat from Hungary to be a kicker, everyone else is kicking like an idiot! He says - "Well, I don't wanna have to kick like an idiot". So finally, he says "Fuck em, I'm gonna kick like I kick". And he's the first guy to kick how they now kick field goals, soccer style. He didn't know he was a genius, he just said "I don't wanna look like an asshole, so I'm gonna muster up the courage to kick like I kick despite the peer pressure". He revolutionised every team in the NFL just by being brave, a little tiny bit. So whatever it is, if you think you have a brilliant idea, don't be afraid to be wrong. </aside>
